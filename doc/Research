Question: What implementations of fractal image compression are out there?

    1. GitHub @ https://github.com/c00kiemon5ter/Fractal-Image-Compression
                                  /tree/master/lib
        - The defaults on lena provide very poor results. Comression expands
          a 475 KB file into a 1.1 MB file, and requires a long length of
          time to do so.

        Is c00kiemon5ter still active? Can I reach out to him about this?
             
    2. GitHub @ https://github.com/l-tamas/Fiasco
        - Submitted an issue because I could not get the build to work.

    3. GitHub @ https://github.com/daleobrien/fractal_mars
        - An amazing tool for compression.
        - Time to compress lena 512: 1.32s
        - Time to decompress lena 512: 0.02s
        - Compression ratio: 768K / 58K = 13.6

    4. GitHub @ https://github.com/plzombie/fractal_image_compression
        - Working tool for compression, long time to compress 512x512 lena
        - Time to compress lena 512: 21.5 minutes!
        - Time to decompress lena 512: 0.3s
        - Compression ratio: 768K / 49K = 16.2

    Note: I will use the fractal_mars (3) implementation to benchmark my
          project.
